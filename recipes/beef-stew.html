            <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut the beef into 2-inch chunks. Then add 
                olive oil into a Dutch oven pot. Bring the 
                heat to high. Once the oill is nearly 
                smoking, add the beef chunks into the pot. 
                Evenly brown each side of the beef chunks. 
                Then remove from the pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the chopped onion and minced garlic 
                into the pot and stir over medium high 
                heat until the onion becomes translucent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the mushrooms and stir until they become 
                tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then add 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp oregano, 2 tsp 
                paprika, 2 tsp salt , and 1/2 tsp black pepper. 
                Stir and cook for about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the celery, baby carrots, and baby red 
                potatoes into the pot, then place the browned 
                beef chunks on top. Give them a quick stir.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in the red wine and chicken stock.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the lid over the pot and bring it to a 
                boil. Remove from the cook top and place it 
                into a 320 Fahrenheit degree oven for 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, with a fork combined 2 tbsp 
                softened butter with 2 tbsp flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                After the beef has cooked for 1 hour, 
                place the butter and flour mixture into the 
                pot and cook for an additional hour with the 
                lid back on. This butter and flour mixture 
                will thicken the beef stew liquids.
