        <h2>Time for some good ol' southern cookin!</h2>
        <p>
            If you're looking for a taste of The South, look no further.
            A cajun dish straight from the heart of Louisiana. A mash-up
            of African, French, and Spanish influences, it spread far and 
            wide throughout the southern states and was made a staple of
            most households.

            <li>1 large bell pepper, seeded and diced</li>
            <li>2 ribs celery, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 (15-ounce) can Red Gold Crushed Tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (14.5-ounce) can Red Gold Diced Tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Creole seasoning</li>
            <li>2 cups parboiled or converted rice</li>
            <li>sliced green onions for garnish, optional</li>
            <li>1 pound large shimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in a stock pot or large dutch oven of medium-high 
                heat. Add the sliced sausage and cook, stirring frequently, 
                until the sausage has browned. Use a slotted spoon to remove the 
                sausage to a plate. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the diced onion, bell pepper, and celery. Cook until the 
                vegetables are tender - about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and 
                cook for about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the broth, Red Gold Crushed Tomatoes, and Red Gold Diced 
                Tomatoes. Add the Creole seasoning. Bring to a boil. Stir in 
                the rice and browned sausage. Reduce the heat to a simmer and 
                cover. Cook about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until 
                the rice is tender to your liking. Taste and add additional 
                Creole seasoning or salt and pepper to your taste. Add the 
                shrimp and cover. Cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes or 
                until the shrimp are pink and cooked through. Allow to rest 
                for about 5 minutes, then stir and serve topped with sliced 
                green onions, if desired.
