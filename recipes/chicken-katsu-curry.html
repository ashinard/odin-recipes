        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the vegetables into chunks: Cut 1 large onion 
                1 large, potato and 1 carrot into small chunks 
                before adding them to a large pan half filled with 
                water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the rice: Bring the water to boil and then 
                simmer for 20 minutes or until the vegetables are 
                soft. It is a good idea to start cooking your rice 
                now.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the curry roux: Remove the saucepan from the heat. 
                Add 4-5 blocks of curry roux to the pot with vegetables. 
                Turn on the heat to low and allow to simmer for 10 
                minutes. Keep mixing until the curry sauce is thick and 
                smooth. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the chicken katsu: While the curry is infusing, 
                season your chicken breast pieces with salt and pepper 
                before covering with flour first and then raw egg, then 
                panko breadcrumbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deep fry the chicken katsu: Heat up the oil in a separate 
                saucepan to 180Â°C and carefully lower the cutlets into the 
                oil and cook them for a few minutes on both sides until 
                they become a golden brown colour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Garnish and enjoy: Slice the cooked chicken katsu into 
                strips and lay over a bed of rice before adding the curry 
                sauce. Garnish with fukujinzuke pickled radish, tonkatsu 
                sauce, and boiled egg halves. Enjoy.
